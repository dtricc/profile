    <h2>My Favorite Trips</h2>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td><img class="flags" src="images/Japan.png" alt="Flag of Japan" id="flag"></td>
        <td>In 2018, I went to Japan with two friends from back home. We started our trip in Tokyo and then made our way south towards the Mount Fuji where we spent some time hiking. After that, we visited the beautiful cities of Kyoto and Osaka. Of course we also stopped for some Kobe beef in Kobe, a town just next to Osaka. After some good nights out we finally returned back to Tokyo and back home to Germany.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><img src="images/Colombia.png" alt="Flag of Colombia" id="flag"></td>
        <td>In 2016, I did a two weeks trip to Colombia. Starting out in Bogotá we flew to the northern coast to Santa Ana and Cartagena. After that, we made our way to Medellín, which was especially thrilling since I just watched the Netflix show 'Narcos' a few weeks before. We visited a lot of the famous places from the series and even met Pablo's brother.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><img src="images/Mexico.png" alt="Flag of Cuba" id="flag"></td>
        <td>In 2015, I visited Mexico together with a friend from home. We spent some time diving (Mexico is famous for its "cenotes", meaning the under-water cage dives). Luckily, it was the Mexican winter, so we had chilled 30° every day (can't remember a single day of rain).</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><img src="images/Brazil.png" alt="Flag of Brazil" id="flag"></td>
        <td>In 2014, I spent six month in Sao Paulo for my semester abroad. One of the first events that I attended was the carnival in Rio de Janeiro, which was a really really awesome week. 2014 was also the year of the World Cup and I was lucky that I had the chance to attend almost every game of the German team who eventually also won the Cup.</td>
